# To Be or Not To Be: A Prespective of Success Philosophy

Life is full of wonders, and can never be fully comprehended as to what will happen next, but there are still some base lines that we can count on to show along our path through it. Most of us, if not all of us will have to make the inevtible choice of "To be or not to be", A mere play of words to the passerby, but a philosophical marvel to the real observer. 

Take for example the first part of the sentence; To be: Being can include everything that you have ever wanted and everything you will ever be. The action of being is the actualization of not only goals and dreams, but thoughts and emotions too. 

The second part of the sentence is "Not to be", and in these three words we can observe a delibrate choice of not being, of taking the other way, and of becomming something else that we haven't primarly chosen "to be". 

Obviously, most of us delibrately choose not being because we lack faith, hope, and belief in what we want to be, and it is only through these trinity, that we might endure and achieve things. 

I have been observing people for years, and I can tell you that most people want to change. Most people know that they have an unrealized potential of  "Being" but they often fall for the easier choice, which is "not to be", often because it's much more comfortable, and much less painful in the process. Regardless, those who choose to be look back on a realized life with no regrets of what might have been. On the other hand, those who choose not to be look back on a life full of dreams and realities that they ignored, out of the hope for comfortness. 

Nothing in this world comes without a tradeoff. A price of exchange. That is the base rule of alchemy, and in parallel the base rule of life. You might fall, you might ache, but you will always be given the chance to stand back up, to be. Now, will you choose to be? ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/94e1208b-7e6e-4f53-ac91-b0af50fc76a5.jpg)
